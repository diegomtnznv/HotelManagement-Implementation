# HotelManagement-Implementation

This project was developed using the principles and patterns of design that I learned in my second year of University. It uses inheritance to create a management system that can be used in Hotels to manage their Rooms- they have the option to clean, book , terminate bookings, approve clean rooms and free rooms when guests leave. This is the basis for PMS development and it was definetely interesting to learn more about JavaScript and its implementations in this area.
